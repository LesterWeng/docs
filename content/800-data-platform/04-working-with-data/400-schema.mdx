## Cannot edit the Prisma schema in the Prisma Data Platform

**Problem**

The Prisma Data Platform does not support the complete development workflow of making iterative changes to your Prisma schema, creating migrations with `npx prisma migrate`, or pushing the schema changes directly to the database with `npx prisma db push`.

For the purposes of consulting your Prisma schema, you can use the **Schema** tab to check your models and their fields and definitions, but you cannot edit and develop your Prisma schema in the Prisma Data Platform.<br /><br />

**Solution**

Use the standard workflow of developing, migrating, and pushing of your Prisma schema locally from your code editor and committing the changes to your project repository on GitHub.
