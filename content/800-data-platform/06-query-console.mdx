Use the Query Console to run the 3 pre-defined `findMany()` test queries or add and test queries of your own using the [Prisma Client API for model queries](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#model-queries).

## UI components

The Query Console is comprised of 2 major UI components - **Query Editor** and **Query Results Console**.

| UI component          | Description                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Query Editor          | • Add, edit, delete queries using the Prisma Client API<br />• Run a selected query |
| Query Results Console | View the results from the selected query                                            |

## Default model queries

- `findMany()` for the first 100 records in the `User` model
- `findMany()` for the first 100 records in the `User` model that match a criteria
- `findMany()` for the first 100 records in the `User` model but only return data from 2 fields

## Run a query

You can test and run queries for your app using Prisma Client from the Query Console and view their results on the right side of the screen.

**Steps**

1. In the Query Editor, place the cursor anywhere in a query block.
2. Run the query using one of the 3 available method.
   - Click the **Run active query** button in the upper-left.
   - Click the **Play** (**Run query**) button at the left margin of the editor.
   - Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (on macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (on Windows).

**Result**

The query results appeare in the right side in the Query Results Console.

## Add a query

The Query Console supports the autocompletion you get when you use your Prisma Client API in Visual Studio Code.

You can use the same autompletion to create and add new queries.

**Steps**

1. Add new lines after an existing query.
2. Define your query. Autocomplete is available as you type the available Prisma models and queries based on the generated Prisma Client for the app.

**Result**

* After you define a query, the green button is available for testing the query.
* The Prisma Data Platform runs on a best-guess basis even if the query code is not completely defined. For example, in the following snippet, the `select` statement is incomplete, but the Prisma Data Platform still runs the `findMany()` query.
   ```js
   await prisma.post.findMany(
   select: )
   ```
