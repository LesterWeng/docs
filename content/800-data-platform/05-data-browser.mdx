## Editing data

In the Table view, you can edit data directly in the table cells, and you can also add new records, and delete existing records.

You can accumulate multiple added rows and edited cells which you can finalize with the **Save changes** button. You cannot accumulate deletes of records. They always complete immediately after you confirm them. In addition, they also force-save any unconfirmed edits.

You can also discard any of the accumulated changes with **Discard changes**.

2. Based on the data allowed in each column, type the data for the record.
